## Installation guidelines

__Step 1:__ 
Create new API keys at:

Musixmatch - https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation

The Movie DB - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

__Step 2:__
Refer to config.template file which has the following contents: 

```// add your api keys and rename this file 'config.js' to make me work!
let config = {
  MY_MUSIC_KEY: "your-musixmatch-key",
  MY_FILM_KEY: "your-moviedb-key"
};
```
__Step 3:__
Add your API keys for Musixmatch and The Movie DB fields.

__Step 4:__ 
Save file and rename as 'config.js' and the site should now be able to access APIs with your keys when you hit submit!


## Project Planning

We started off looking at the list of recommended APIs and discussed ideas on which ones would be suitable to reflect the personalities of our team.  

We quickly agreed on an 80s BACK TO THE FUTURE THEME which would incorporate the Movie DB API and MUSIC API to let you 
go back in time to the year of your birth! What was the world like?

We sketched out a template of what the one page site would look like:

Followed by a list of tasks that we would commit as issues:
