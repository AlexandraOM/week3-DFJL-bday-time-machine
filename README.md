We started off looking at the list of recommended APIs and discussed ideas on which ones would be suitable to reflect the personalities of our team.  

We quickly agreed on an 80s BACK TO THE FUTURE THEME which would incorporate the Movie DB API and MUSIC API to let you 
go back in time to the year of your birth! What was the world like?

We sketched out a template of what the one page site would look like:
